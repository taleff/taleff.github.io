This is my personal website. I built it to present publications I have written and personal projects I have completed. Additionally, I'm using it as a way to learn how to use tools like git.

## About Me

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by [Professor Damien Guironnet](https://guironnet.chbe.illinois.edu) and I research the use of reactor engineering principles to predictively control polymer structure. I'm originally from Austin, Texas and enjoy cycling.
