# taleff.github.io

This is my personal website. I built it to present publications I have written and personal projects I have completed. Additionally, I'm using it as a way to learn how to use tools like git.

## About Me

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by [Professor Damien Guironnet](https://guironnet.chbe.illinois.edu) and I research the use of reactor engineering principles to predictively control polymer structure. I'm originally from Austin, Texas and enjoy cycling.

## Building and Running Locally

So I can remember how to maintain my site, here are instructions on how to build and run it locally:

1. **Install Dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Run Local Server**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

3. **View the Site**:
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

The server will automatically rebuild the site when you make changes to files. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

**Note**: You need Ruby installed on your system to run Jekyll locally. For more details, see the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
